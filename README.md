# CoflowSimulator

### Generators
#### Generation of network fabric
The network fabric is represented by `M` machines or end-hosts connected to a non-blocking Big-Switch fabric, of which each access link has a normalized capacity of `1`.

#### Generation of coflows
TBU

### List of implemented algorithms:
- `CS-MHA` (cf. [Luo2016]
- `CDS-LPA`, `CDS-LPA` (cf. [Tseng2018])
- `DCoflow` (three versions: `DCoflow_v1`, `DCoflow_v2`, and `DCoflow_MH`, cf. [Luu2022])
- `Sincronia` (cf. [Agarwal2018])
- `Varys` (cf. [Chowdhury2014])
